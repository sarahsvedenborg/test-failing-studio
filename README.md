## Getting Started

### 1. Start a new repo with the [GitHub template](https://github.com/new?template_name=next-sanity-template&template_owner=nuotsu)

### 2. Retrieve a new Sanity project ID

```sh
npm -y create sanity@latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> The CLI will ask to create new a directory with the Sanity files, but you can remove once the project ID is retrieved.

### 3. Update environment variables

```sh
# /next/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID = ...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_TOKEN = ... # retrieve from https://sanity.io/manage

# /sanity/.env.local
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID = ...
SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL = ... # your live or staging site URL
```

### 4. Populate the Sanity project with content

- Site settings ([sanity/schemas/documents/site.ts](sanity/schemas/documents/site.ts))
- Pages ([sanity/schemas/documents/page.ts](sanity/schemas/documents/page.ts))
- Blog posts ([sanity/schemas/documents/blog.post.ts](sanity/schemas/documents/blog.post.ts))

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Required: Add a page with the slug `index` for the Homepage<br>
> Optional: Add a page with the slug `404` for the 404 page

### 5. Set up the Sanity Dashboard with your deployment service

```sh
# Vercel — https://www.sanity.io/plugins/vercel-dashboard-widget
npm i sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-vercel

# Netlify — https://www.sanity.io/plugins/sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-netlify
npm i sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-netlify
```

### 6. Customize the frontend

Feel free to adjust styles, add more schema and modules, and more.

## Visual Editing

> [!NOTE]
> Currently in beta; Currently only works on the local development environment of the Sanity Studio.

Content can be edited and previewed live from the Sanity Presentation mode by navigating to the **Editor** tab in the Studio.

## Staging

Create a new git branch (call it anything—e.g. `staging` or `preview`) and set an environment variable specific to that branch in your deployment service (Vercel or Netlify):

```sh
# Environment variable for the staging branch (in Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
ENABLE_PREVIEW = true
```

Now you can use the preview deployment URL to share staged content (unpublished changes) with your team or clients.
